      <p>
         One of the most powerful things I've learned is that the way my life is now is because of the series of choices that I've made. If I don't like the way that I am living, I need to make different choices. Taking accountability can be difficult for the average person. However, once you take accountability for your choices it gives you the power to change your life. To change your life, first you must change your mind.
